Request/Response Cycle

When you type http://localhost:8000/welcome, the browser makes a request for the URL /welcome.
The request hits the Rails router.
The router maps the URL to a controller action to handle the request.
The controller action recieves the request, and asks the model to fetch data from the database.
The model returns data to the controller action.
The controller action passes the data on to the view.
The view renders the page as HTML.
The controller sends the HTML back to the browser.

rails new MessengerApp
bundle install
http://localhost:8000
